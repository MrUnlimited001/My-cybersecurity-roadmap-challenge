# 🖧 Week 2: Networking Basics

Welcome to Week 2 of my 90-Day Cybersecurity Roadmap Challenge 🚀
This week focuses on networking fundamentals, exploring IP addressing, ports, protocols, and packet analysis.

## 📆 Daily Breakdown
---

### 📅 Day 8:
Goal: Learn IP, MAC, Subnetting Basics

- Watched 3 YouTube crash courses on IP, MAC, and subnetting.
- Learned what IP Address is and how IP addressing works (IPv4 / IPv6).
- Understood MAC addresses and their role at Layer 2.
- Practiced subnetting problems (CIDR notation).
  
---

### 📅 Day 9:
Goal: Learn use of ifconfig, ip a, ping and traceroute (Network Commands)

Practiced:
- ifconfig / ip a (view network interfaces)
- ping (test connectivity)
- traceroute (trace packet path from networks to destination)
- Captured screenshots of each command's output.
  
---

### 📅 Day 10:
Goal: Learn TCP vs UDP, Ports & Services

- Watched a YouTube video on transport layer protocols.
- Compared TCP (connection-oriented) & UDP (connectionless) based on features such as connection, reliability, speed, ordering and use cases.
- Learned about ports.
- Noted down and memorized common ports (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP, DNS, etc).

---

### 📅 Day 11:
Goal: Install Wireshark, Capture some packets (observe DNS, HTTP)

- Installed Wireshark.
- Learned about the capture filter and display filters.
- Watched a YouTube video on how to capture packets with Wireshark.
- Captured and analyzed DNS and HTTP traffic.
- Observed request/response flow in real-time.

---

### 📅 Day 12:
Goal: Do OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 6–10).

- Had to repeat Bandit levels 0 to 5, since I didn't save the passwords.
- Solved Bandit levels 6 to 10.
- Documented my steps & commands I used.

---

### 📅 Day 13:
Goal: Learn Netcat Basics (nc, port scanning)

- Learned what netcat is used for;
- Simple chat between two terminals.
- Basic port scanning. (checking for open ports in a target system)
- Banner grabbing. (identify services running on open ports)
- File transfer. (Send and receive files over a network)
- Create a backdoor. (For reverse shell for hacking/ penetration testing)

---

### 📅 Day 14: Networking Recap
- Wrote a detailed recap summarizing all key learnings.
- Highlighted tools, commands, and key takeaways.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Linux terminal** (ifconfig, ip a, ping, traceroute)

## 🎯 Goals For Next Week 
- Install Python,  run "Hello World"
- Learn variables, loops, conditionals. 
- Learn Python functions + file handling.
- Write a script: a portfolio scanner (use socket library).
- Install Git, push your scripts + notes to GitHub.
- Do OverTheWire Bandit Levels 11-15.
