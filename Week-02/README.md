# ðŸ–§ Week 2: Networking Basics

Welcome to Week 2 of my 90-Day Cybersecurity Roadmap Challenge ðŸš€
This week focuses on networking fundamentals, exploring IP addressing, ports, protocols, and packet analysis.

## ðŸ“† Daily Breakdown
---

### ðŸ“… Day 8:
Goal: Learn IP, MAC, Subnetting Basics

- Watched 3 YouTube crash courses on IP, MAC, and subnetting.
- Learned what IP Address is and how IP addressing works (IPv4 / IPv6).
- Understood MAC addresses and their role at Layer 2.
- Practiced subnetting problems (CIDR notation).
  
---

### ðŸ“… Day 9:
Goal: Learn use of ifconfig, ip a, ping and traceroute (Network Commands)

Practiced:
- ifconfig / ip a (view network interfaces)
- ping (test connectivity)
- traceroute (trace packet path from networks to destination)
- Captured screenshots of each command's output.
  
---

### ðŸ“… Day 10:
Goal: Learn TCP vs UDP, Ports & Services

- Watched a YouTube video on transport layer protocols.
- Compared TCP (connection-oriented) & UDP (connectionless) based on features such as connection, reliability, speed, ordering and use cases.
- Learned about ports.
- Noted down and memorized common ports (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP, DNS, etc).

---

### ðŸ“… Day 11:
Goal: Install Wireshark, Capture some packets (observe DNS, HTTP)

- Installed Wireshark.
- Learned about the capture filter and display filters.
- Watched a YouTube video on how to capture packets with Wireshark.
- Captured and analyzed DNS and HTTP traffic.
- Observed request/response flow in real-time.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 12:
Goal: Do OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 6â€“10).

- Had to repeat Bandit levels 0 to 5, since I didn't save the passwords.
- Solved Bandit levels 6 to 10.
- Documented my steps & commands I used.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 13:
Goal: Learn Netcat Basics (nc, port scanning)

- Learned what netcat is used for;
- Simple chat between two terminals.
- Basic port scanning. (checking for open ports in a target system)
- Banner grabbing. (identify services running on open ports)
- File transfer. (Send and receive files over a network)
- Create a backdoor. (For reverse shell for hacking/ penetration testing)

---

### ðŸ“… Day 14: Networking Recap
- Wrote a detailed recap summarizing all key learnings.
- Highlighted tools, commands, and key takeaways.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Linux terminal** (ifconfig, ip a, ping, traceroute)
- **Wireshark**
- **Netcat**
- **OverTheWire Bandit**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Hands-on Practice
- âœ… Hands-on practice with real network commands
- âœ… Captured and analyzed live network traffic
- âœ… Strengthened understanding of IP, MAC, TCP/UDP, and ports
- âœ… Successfully completed Bandit levels 6â€“10
