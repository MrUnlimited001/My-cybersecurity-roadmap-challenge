# 🐧 Week 1: Linux Basics

Welcome to **Week 1** of my **90-Day Cybersecurity Roadmap Challenge** 🚀  
This week I built my Linux foundation, installed Kali Linux, learned core commands, and practiced using SSH through OverTheWire Bandit.

---

## 📆 Daily Breakdown

### 📅 Day 1: Install VirtualBox + Kali Linux
- Installed VirtualBox.
- Installed Kali Linux VM.
- Took my **first VM snapshot** to have a restore point.

---

### 📅 Day 2: Linux File Navigation
- Learned `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`.
- Practiced navigating directories and reading files.

---

### 📅 Day 3: Linux Permissions
- Learned `ls -l` to read file permissions.
- Practiced `chmod` (change permissions) and `chown` (change ownership).

---

### 📅 Day 4: File Editing
- Learned `nano` and `vim` editors.
- Used `touch` and `mkdir` to create files and directories.

---

### 📅 Day 5: Process Management
- Learned `ps`, `top`, `kill`.
- Practiced finding and terminating processes.

---

### 📅 Day 6: OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 0–5)
- Practiced SSH and solved Bandit Levels 0 to 5.

---

### 📅 Day 7: Documentation
- Documented everything I learned and created this GitHub repo.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **VirtualBox** (VM host)
- **Kali Linux** (VM guest)
- **Linux shell** (bash)
- **OverTheWire Bandit** (SSH practice)

---
## 🛠️ Hands-on Practice
- Installed and configured my first Linux VM
- Completed OverTheWire Bandit levels 0-5
- Set file permissions on test files in my Kali VM
- Practiced process management (ps, top, kill)

## ✅ Summary Of What I Learned
- Basics of Linux file system navigation (ls, cd, pwd)
- File permissions and ownership (chmod, chown)
- Editing files with nano and vim
- How to create and remove files/directories (touch, mkdir, rm)
  
## 🚀 Challenges Faced
- Struggled with remembering chmod numeric values.
- Took time to understand file ownership concepts.

## 🎯 Goals for Next Week
- Practice networking basics (ping, netstat, ifconfig)
- Learn about ports and services
- Learn netcat basics (nc, port scanning)
- Continue OverTheWire Bandit (levels 6-10)
