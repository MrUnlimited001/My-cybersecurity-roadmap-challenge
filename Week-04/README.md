### 📅 Day 24:
Goal: Do TryHackMe: OWASP TOP 10 part 1 
-	Worked through TryHackMe – “OWASP Top 10” (Part 1), practicing exploitation of vulnerabilities like IDOR and Broken Authentication.

---

### 📅 Day 25:
Goal:  Do TryHackMe: “OWASP TOP 10” part 2
-	Completed TryHackMe – OWASP Top 10 (Part 2), focusing on XSS, Insecure Deserialization, and other advanced topics.

### 📅 Day 26:
Goal: Practice intercepting requests with Burp 
-	Configured my browser:
1.	Set proxy in the browser.
2.	Installed Burp’s CA Certificate (for http/ https interception)
-	Started Burp and enabled intercept. 
-	Practiced Intercepting & Modifying Requests. 
-	Explored Repeatee for testing.

### 📅 Day 27: Web-Hacking Recap
- Wrote a detailed recap summarizing all key learnings.
- Highlighted tools, commands, and key takeaways.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Linux Firefox Browser**
- **TryHackme Website**
- **Burp**

---

## 📌 Hands-on Practice
- ✅ Proxy configuration on my browser
- ✅ Intercepted and modified requests with Burp.
- ✅ Strengthened understanding of web hacking with TryHackMe machines and tasks.

---

## ✅️ Summary Of What I Learned
-	Learned how to identify and exploit common web vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled environment.
-	Gained hands-on experience with Burp Suite as a web proxy tool for testing and debugging requests.
-	Strengthened understanding of HTTP methods, sessions, cookies, and authentication flaws.
-	Improved confidence in recognizing and mitigating OWASP Top 10 risks.

## 🎯 Goals For Next Week 
-	Learn Nmap basics (scanning).
-	TryHackMe Nmap room.
-	Do TryHackMe: “Basic Pentesting”.
-	Learn service enumeration (FTP, SSH, SMB).
-	Do TryHackMe: “Enumeration” room. 
-	Practice with my Kali VM (scan localhost services).
-	Write scanning recap in GitHub.
