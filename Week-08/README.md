# 🖧 Week 8 (Days 51–57): Blue Team Basics.

Welcome to Week 8 of my 90-Days Cybersecurity Roadmap Challenge 🚀
This week focuses on understanding and applying core Blue Team concepts, including log analysis, SIEM fundamentals, threat hunting, and detection strategies.

## 📆 Daily Breakdown

---

### 📅 Day 51
Goal:  TryHackMe: Intro to Log Analysis
-	Explored how log files provide valuable insights into user and system activities.
-	Learned how to identify suspicious events using structured log data.
-	Practiced parsing logs for authentication attempts, process creation, and network events.

📝 *Key takeaway:* Logs are the backbone of threat detection — every alert starts with data.

---

### 📅 Day 52
Goal: SIEM Basics
- Learned how **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** systems aggregate and correlate logs from multiple sources.  
- Covered concepts like:
  - Event correlation
  - Alerts and dashboards
  - Incident response workflows  
- Reviewed popular SIEM tools such as **Splunk**, **IBM QRadar**, and **Azure Sentinel**.

📝 *Key takeaway:* SIEM tools empower analysts to detect patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed.

---

### 📅 Day 53 
Goal:  TryHackMe: Pyramid of Pain
- Studied the **Pyramid of Pain** and how different indicators affect adversaries:
  - Hash Values 🧩 (Easy to change)
  - IP Addresses 🌐 (Moderate difficulty)
  - TTPs — Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures ⚔️ (Hardest to change)
- Understood why focusing on higher-level indicators increases defensive effectiveness.

📝 *Key takeaway:* Targeting adversary behaviors (TTPs) creates lasting defensive value.

---

### 📅  Day 54
Goal: Windows Event Log Analysis
-	Practiced analyzing **Windows Security Event Logs** using Event Viewer.  
-	Investigated:
-	Logon events (4624, 4625)
-	Process creation events (4688)
-	Privilege escalation indicators  
-	Learned how to interpret Event Ids to spot anomalies.
📝 *Key takeaway:* Recognizing log patterns helps detect intrusions early.

---

### 📅 Day 55 
Goal:  TryHackMe: Threat Hunting
-	Hands-on exercise in identifying malicious activity proactively.
-	Used hypotheses-driven investigation to search for attacker footprints.
-	Learned about frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK** to structure hunting efforts.

📝 *Key takeaway:* Threat hunting is about finding what your SIEM missed.

---

### 📅 Day 56 
Goal:  Write Blue Team Notes on GitHub.
- Compiled detailed notes summarizing:
  - Log sources and event types
  - SIEM architecture and functions
  - Hunting methodologies and detection techniques
- Structured content for GitHub sharing and community learning.

📝 *Key takeaway:* Clear documentation accelerates skill retention and knowledge sharing.

---

### 📅  Day 57 
Goal: LinkedIn Share**
-	Published my GitHub progress post for Week 8 to inspire fellow learners.
-	Highlighted the importance of Blue Team fundamentals in cybersecurity development.

🔗 *LinkedIn Post:* [Coming Soon!]

## 📌 Hands-on Practice
- ✅ Analysed windows event logs with CyberChef
- ✅ Detected events in logistics files with Sigma.
- ✅ Reviewed popular SIEM tools such as Splunk, Azure Sentinel etc
- ✅ Detected and responded to TTPs in a simulated site

## ✅️ Summary Of What I Learned
This week deepened my defensive mindset. Understanding how attackers leave traces — and how defenders trace them back — is crucial for SOC and incident response roles. 
- **Log Analysis**  - Parsing and interpreting logs to identify anomalies. 
- **SIEM** - Aggregating, correlating, and visualizing security data. 
- **Threat Hunting** -  Proactive search for adversarial behavior. 
- **Documentation** - Translating technical learning into shared knowledge. 
Blue Teaming isn’t just about tools; it’s about thinking like a hunter.

## 🎯 Goals For Next Week 
- Day 58 - 60: Play a beginner CTF (CTFtime.org/ PicoCTF).
- Day 61 -63: Write full detailed writeups and publish on GitHub. 
- Day 64: Build a small Python tool (e.g.,password generator, log parser).
